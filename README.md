Shor's Algorithm Implementation with Quantum Rings
Dependencies
QuantumRingsLib: Quantum computing simulation library.
numpy: For numerical computations.
matplotlib.pyplot: For plotting results.

Constants
N: 899 (number to factor)
a: 7 (base for modular exponentiation, coprime with N)
n: 10 (bit length of N)

Setup
Connects to Quantum Rings service with provided credentials.
Selects "scarlet_quantum_rings" backend.
Sets 5000 shots for statistical reliability.

Quantum Registers
q_x: Exponent register (n qubits)
q_a: Result of a^x mod N (n qubits)
c: Classical register for measurement (n bits)
ancilla: For intermediate calculations (n qubits)
qc: Quantum circuit object

Circuit Operations
Initialization: Applies Hadamard gates to q_x for superposition.
Modular Exponentiation: Simplified function modular_exponentiation computes a^x mod N.
IQFT: iqft_cct performs inverse Quantum Fourier Transform on q_x.
Measurement: Measures q_x into c.

Execution
Runs the circuit on the backend.
Monitors job with job_monitor.
Analyzes and prints results.

Visualization
Plots measurement outcomes with matplotlib.
